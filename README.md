This Page contains two main parts: 

1. [The homepage](http://taoalpha.github.io) is a single web page with a list of my personal projects, have a look if you want;
2. [The blog](http://taoalpha.github.io/blog/) is a new project, I will update it as frequently as I can. And most of the posts will be related to Technology and Coding, some about Design and Human-Computer Interaction. Hope you like it.
